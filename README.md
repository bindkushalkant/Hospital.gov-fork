# Hospital.gov
When the website opens, it will prompt the user with two pop-ups: one for location and one for preferred language.

In the background, there will be an AI chatbot nurse, using Gemini or the ChatGPT API if possible, until we develop our own AI nurse.

The background will feature an animation connecting nearby hospitals to the user, displayed on a map of India, the world, or the local area.

On the second page, there will be a sliding list of nearby hospitals.

The header will include the following sections: Home, Services, What's New Nearby, and Location of Hospitals. also include help for the fresher user who don't know how to use the application.

we can have one more option there will be a pop-up for the area and when the user selects the area it will show the nearby hospitals lists.
